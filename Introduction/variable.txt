In order to store in the computer memory a value given by the
user (using the keyboard) or computed by the program, we need
to define a variable of an appropriate type.

To store the length of side of a square we type
double side;

In result we can use variable side that is of double type â€“
double represents real values.

When the program runs, in the computer memory an appropriate
area (corresponding to the size of the type, in that case 8 bytes)
is reserved.

The area is referred to by the variable name.

The variable named side is not initialized, it means that has a
random value. The compiler puts the variable somewhere in
memory and treats whatever bit pattern was in that memory as
the variable initial state.

Each variable can be initialized with a value when it is defined,
e.g. when we type
double side=0;
the variable side is initialized with zero.

// SCOPE
We can use a variable from the point
of the variable definition till the end
of the block where it is defined.
