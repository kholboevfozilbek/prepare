C++ defines a set of flow-of-control statements that allow statements to be executed conditionally or
repeatedly.

Simple statements – statements that end with a semicolon.
For example.:
a=300;
a++;
c=a+b;
; the null statement


Compound statements – are a sequence of simple statements surrounded by a pair of curly
braces { }.
For example.:
{
a=300;
a++;
c=a+b;
}
A compound statement, usually is referred to as a block.

Declaration statements
For example.:
int a=67;
