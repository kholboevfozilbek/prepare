Comments help the human readers of our programs.

They are typically used to summarize an algorithm, identify the purpose of a variable, or clarify an
obscure segment of code.

Comments do not increase the size of the executable program.

The compiler ignores all comments.

1. Single line comments 

// comment

2. Multi-line comments

/* 

*/

Comment pairs generally are used
for multi-line explanations,
whereas double slash comments
tend to be used for half-line and
single line remarks.
