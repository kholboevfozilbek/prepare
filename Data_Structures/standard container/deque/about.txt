#   Double ended queue

-> deque (usually pronounced like "deck") is an irregular acronym of double-ended queue. 
-> Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends   (either its front or its back).

-> Specific libraries may implement deques in different ways, generally as some form of dynamic array.

# RANDOM ACCESS POSSIBLE

->  Therefore, they provide a functionality similar to vectors, but with efficient insertion and deletion of elements also at the beginning of the sequence, and not only at its end. 


#   Both vectors and deques provide a very similar interface and can be used for similar purposes, but internally both work in quite different ways: While vectors use a single array that needs to be occasionally reallocated for growth, the elements of a deque can be scattered in different chunks of storage, with the container keeping the necessary information internally to provide direct access to any of its elements in constant time and with a uniform sequential interface (through iterators). Therefore, deques are a little more complex internally than vectors, but this allows them to grow more efficiently under certain circumstances, especially with very long sequences, where reallocations become more expensive.

!!! For operations that involve frequent insertion or removals of elements at positions other than the beginning or the end, deques perform worse and have less consistent iterators and references than lists and forward lists.


# Container Properties
->  Sequence
        Elements in sequence containers are ordered in a strict linear sequence. Individual elements are accessed by their position in this sequence.

->  Dynamic array
        Generally implemented as a dynamic array, it allows direct access to any element in the sequence and provides relatively fast addition/removal of elements at the beginning or the end of the sequence.

->  Allocator-aware
        The container uses an allocator object to dynamically handle its storage needs.
